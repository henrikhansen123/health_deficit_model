I will in this paper review the empirical litterature on the Health Deficit
 Model by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The model explains the aging process as the accumulation of health deficits
 over time, which is in contrast with Health Capital Model by

\begin_layout Standard
In the 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "grossmanConceptHealthCapital1972"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 model (Health Capital Model; HCM), health is a capital stock that depreciates
 following the law of motion of health capital
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{H}\left(t\right)=I\left(t\right)+\left(1-\delta\left(t\right)\right)H\left(t\right).\label{eq:law of motion of health capital}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is health stock at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 is non-negative health investments at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 is the depreciation of health capital at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 In short, there are 3 empirical problems with the Health Capital Model.
 Firstly, from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:law of motion of health capital"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the amount of depreciation is increasing in health capital, which imply
 that healthy individuals lose more health per period.
 Secondly, if the depreciation rate is constant, then life is infinite.
 This follows from solving equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:law of motion of health capital"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 (assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $I\left(t\right)=0$
\end_inset

 for simplicity): 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int\left[\dot{H}\left(t\right)-\left(1-\delta\right)H\left(t\right)\right]dt=\int\left[\frac{d}{dt}\left(H\left(t\right)e^{-\left(1-\delta\right)t}\right)\right]dt=H\left(t\right)e^{-\left(1-\delta\right)t}
\]

\end_inset

which is only equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 life is infinite.
 As many health choices revolves around end-of-life care, it makes the Health
 Capital Model hard to use empirically.
 Thirdly, health is a latent variable, which is hard to measure empirically.
 These three problems with the Health Capital Model justify looking for
 alternative theoretical models to base testable predictions on.

What reliability theory is
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Reliability theory is a sub-discipline of systems engineering (the study
 of how to engineer complex systems over their life-cycle) that focuses
 on how long a system can survive.
 In reliability theory, a system is the interaction of individual components,
 which can include machines and, in this literature review, humans.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
What aging is
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In reliability theory, a system is aging, if the probability that it dies
 increases, i.e.
 the mortality rate increases.
 A system whose mortality rate isn't increasing is said to be non-aging.
 A non-aging system is, however, not immortal, but it can only die by a
 constant probability.
 Importantly, reliability theory assumes that all the systems' components
 are non-aging.

Deriving the fundamental equations of reliability theory
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $S\left(t\right)=P\left(T\geq t\right)$
\end_inset

 be the survival function, i.e.
 the probability that the time of death 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is beyond time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 The mortality rate is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mu\left(t\right)=-\frac{dS_{t}}{S_{t}dt}=-\frac{d\ln S_{t}}{dt}.\label{eq:failure_rate}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

An aging system is one where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu^{\prime}\left(t\right)>0$
\end_inset

, and a non-aging system is one where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu^{\prime}\left(t\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 It follows from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:failure_rate"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 that the survival function for non-aging systems is exponential.
 According to Gompertz law, the mortality rate must be exponential, such
 that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mu\left(t\right)=Re^{\alpha t}\label{eq:Gompertz_law}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $R,\alpha>0$
\end_inset

 are parameters.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Redundancies of components:
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In reliability theory, every individual component of a system is non-aging,
 but the system as whole is.
 Aging is an emerging property, which is explained by the breakdown of redundanc
ies of components.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1-p$
\end_inset

 denote the probability that a component fails, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 be the number of components.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q=0.5$
\end_inset

, then the probability that the system fails, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, is 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=q^{n}=\left(1-p\right)^{n}=0.5^{2}=0.25$
\end_inset

.
 The survival rate is then 
\begin_inset Formula $S\left(t\right)=1-Q=1-\left(1-p\right)^{n}=0.75$
\end_inset

.
 However, since every component doesn't age, then 
\begin_inset Formula $p=e^{-kt}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is some constant.
 From 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:failure_rate"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 I then have that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mu\left(t\right)=\frac{nke^{-kt}\left(1-e^{-kt}\right)^{n-1}}{1-\left(1-e^{-kt}\right)^{n}}.\label{eq:mortality_rate_biology}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For a low 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 this is approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(t\right)\approx nk^{n}t^{n-1}$
\end_inset

, as 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-kt}\approx1-kt$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 around 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, but for high 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(t\right)\approx k$
\end_inset

, as 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-kt}\approx0$

The paper 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "mitnitskiAccumulationDeficitsProxy2001"

\end_inset

 focuses on how to determine biological age from what they call “deficits”,
 i.e.
 signs, symptoms, diseases, etc.
 They do this, because chronological age is not a good predictor of biological
 age, as humans are heterogeneous in their mortality rate at any level of
 chronological age.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 create a frailty index, that is the number of deficits a person has, divided
 by total number of potential deficits.
 The frailty index is a proxy for biological age.
 They find that the frailty index follows a Gamma-distribution for a representat
ive sample of old Canadians.
 This relates to the reliability theory of biological aging, because the
 Gamma-distribution is what you find systems with many redundancies.
 The reason for this is that while….
 While

 proxy for aging does find a strong exponential relationship between age
 and frailty of 3.3% increase in the frailty index each year, they, however,
 2194 older individuals.

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "mitnitskiAccumulationDeficitsAge2002"

\end_inset

 they extend their analysis for the frailty index to include many different
 age groups and gender for a larger sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They find that while women are more frail, i.e.
 they have a higher frailty index, they, compared to men, have a lower force
 of mortality, i.e.
 they don’t age as fast as men.
 They call this relationship the Compensation Law of Frailty, which is akin
 to the Compensation Law of Mortality from gerontology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They use this relationship to determine, from the frailty index, the Species-Spe
cific life-span, i.e.
 at what age the two curves of frailty accumulation intersect.
 The estimate yields a life-span of 94 (SE=1), which is almost the same,
 95 (SE=1) as found when looking at mortality rates.
 This almost one-to-one relationship between estimating life-span from mortality
 rates and frailty indices imply that mortality rates can be proxied as
 the accumulation of deficits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is also what would be expected from reliability theory, because this
 theory implies that aging (increase in mortality rates) is the decumulation
 of redundancy.
 And more deficits would in this context be the bodily expression of the
 loss of redundancy of parallel structures

 The SHARE dataset is created by repeated sampling of retirerees in Europe,

 The survey includes questions on health-related factors, that

 use that SHARE is a panel-dataset to estimate individual fixed effects

 These panel-data methods allow them to show whether the biology laws hold
 at the individual level.
 This contribution is important for theoretical work that builds uses the
 health deficit model and uses a representative agent, because it might
 be that the Gompertz law only hold in the aggregate.

The estimates above imply allowing for the Makeham-term increases the rate

 3 percentage point for women.
 Theoretical calibrations of models that allow for the Makeham-term should

 accumulation,

They use OLS, random effects and Mundlak regressions.
 They do not use fixed effects, because hunger episodes are constant across
 time per individual.
 The random effects model requires that the composite errors and the regressors
 are uncorrelated.
 This is a strong assumption, which is a reason why it isn't used as much
 empirically as the fixed effects estimator, despite it being more efficient.
 However, as the regressors are age, i.e.
 time, then it implies that if the random effects estimator is biased, then
 so would the fixed effects estimator also be.

 In the IV regressions they use statutory ages of retirement as instruments,

 If for example a worker is subject to a workplace injury, she will get
 a sudden increase in the deficit at the period of injury, but she might
 also retire early because of the injury, if it is disabling.
 In this case, the

Earlier research on occupational choice and health have not estimated the

 This contributes to the previous research by estimating the effect of occupatio

 This occupational effect is important for health care literature and general

The long-term consequences of occupational choice on health are especially
 important, if the short-term effects are small, but the long-term effects
 are large.
 Then causal estimates from, say, difference-in-difference litterature,

 they examine how health is depreciating over the life-cycle.
 They use self-reported health from the National Health Interview Survey
 (NHIS).
 A time-series plot show that self-reported health deteriorates with time.
 They split up the sample by the bottom- and top quartile, and they find
 that the bottom quartile decreases their health faster than the top quartile.
 However, the self-reported health is unchanged for the bottom after age
 60, but still rising for the top quartile.
 The two lines intersect at….

They want to know how work affects health throughout the life-cycle.

Finding causal determinants of health is tricky, as it is subject to multiple
 unobserved confounders.
 They use the Grossman-model of health, but they criticize it for the unrealisti
c assumption, that death is chosen, and that with a constant depreciation
 of capital, the optimal chose is an infinite live.
 They argue that the wrong assumption is that there exists a technology,
 that can restore health.
 Weakining that assumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A problem with the evidence is their use of self-reported health.
 It has been shown [WHERE] that the correlation between latent health and
 self-reported health is weak at best.
 However, from a welfare analysis perspective, the health that is in the
 utility function can only be the self-reported health.
 Otherwise, they wouldn’t receive utility from it.

Another problem is self-selection into manual work by health.

 The main question

 the Health Deficit Model assuming a causal link from income to longevity.
 The Preston Curve is the empirical regularity, that richer countries have
 healthier populations, but that the function from income to health is concave.

 to smooth consumption, which it does by investing in health.

\begin_layout Standard
One of the major findings in this paper are not, necessarily, the inclusion
 of the childhood period, but insted the derivation of the Health Deficit
 Model from Reliability Theory.
 The Reliability Theory of biological organisms states that humans are

like machines, made up of redundant parts, many of which are defective from
 the start

\begin_layout Standard
If we take seriously that reliability theory should be at the foundation
 of health models, because humans age like machines, then we should at least
 also use reliability theory in our capital accumulation models.
 If biological and mechanical systems deterioate in the same manner, then
 they should be modeled equally.
 This implies that the capital accumulation equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:Law of motion of capital"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 should be replaced with something like
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{k}\left(t\right)=E+Be^{\mu t}\Rightarrow\dot{D}_{k}\left(t\right)=\mu\left(D_{k}\left(t\right)-E\right),
\]

\end_inset

in steady state 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{\prime}\left(t\right)=Y\left(t\right)-C\left(t\right)-D_{k}\left(t\right)=0$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K^{\prime}\left(t\right)=0\iff Y\left(t\right)-C\left(t\right)=S\left(t\right)=D_{k}\left(t\right)=E+Be^{\mu t}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $S\left(t\right)=sY\left(t\right)=\left(1-s\right)C\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The growth in savings in steady state would be where
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
g_{s}\left(t\right)\equiv\frac{S^{\prime}\left(t\right)}{S\left(t\right)} & =\frac{\mu Be^{\mu t}}{E+Be^{\mu t}}=\frac{D_{k}^{\prime}\left(t\right)}{D_{k}\left(t\right)},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{s}\left(t\right)=\mu$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is capital shocks with mean 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and variance 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

, then for a negative shock (suddenly higher deterioation of capital), the
 social planner would increase growth rate in savings by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-\frac{\partial g_{s}\left(t\right)}{\partial E}=\frac{D_{k}^{\prime}\left(t\right)}{D_{k}\left(t\right)^{2}}=\frac{g_{s}\left(t\right)}{D_{k}\left(t\right)}
\]

\end_inset

which would disappear in the long run as 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{s}\left(t\right)\rightarrow\mu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{k}\left(t\right)\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

.
 However, this would imply that savings should always increase as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
g_{s}\left(t\right) & =\frac{S^{\prime}\left(t\right)}{S\left(t\right)}=\frac{Y^{\prime}\left(t\right)-C^{\prime}\left(t\right)}{Y\left(t\right)-C\left(t\right)}\\

\frac{Y\left(t\right)}{C\left(t\right)} & =\frac{g_{Y}-\frac{\mu Be^{\mu t}}{E+Be^{\mu t}}}{g_{C}-\frac{\mu Be^{\mu t}}{E+Be^{\mu t}}}\\

 he creates a life-cycle model of the effect of education on longevity,
 by using the health deficit model.
 In the model there is heterogenous returns to education, so individuals
 choose educational level according to their return.
 The new thing is that because health investments can increase longevity,
 by decreasing the accumulation of health deficits, it can explain the positive
 correlation between education and longevity.
 As per period marginal utility is diminishing, it makes sense to increase
 longevity to increase consumption at the longer life.
 This implies that the causality goes from education to longevity, and not
 the other way around.

Strulik (2018) then calibrate his model with using the estimates from ([Mitnitsk

 they further develop their health deficit model to include the infant-mortality
 period.
 They use constraints from physics, together with biology, to model the
 infant-mortality period as a period of increasing redundancy, i.e.
 a decreasing deficit accumulation.
 By during this modeling of the infant period, they can create the empirical
 regularity known as the bathtub-curve of mortality

They then run computer experiments by creating shocks of different magnitude
 in the fetal state.
 The experiments suggest that small shocks in utero leads to large differences
 in longevity, i.e.
 large differences in health deficits at late-life.

In other words, they create a model that can encompass the Fetal Origins
 Hypothesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They develop the fetal period using the von Bertalanffy equation, which
 is based on physical laws.
 The equation basically states that human growth is high when the mass is
 low, but the growth decreases in size.
 They split the development of the human body into a in utero developmental
 phase and a childhood developmental phase, which is distinguished by the
 parameter on the change in the growth of the number of body cells, and
 the energy needed to maintain a body cell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the childhood development phase, the frailty index is convex in age,
 in that the frailty index decreases from birth until age 7, and then increases
 from there on.

A problem with the model is the kink at age 20.

 he creates a model of imperfectly rational addiction, in which he incorporates
 the health deficit model.
 The model examines the behavior of two types of addiction: Rational addiction
 and imperfect rational addiction.

One of the strengths of the paper is its use behavioral assumptions, that
 only makes addiction irrational, instead of assuming that all choices of
 the agent is irrational like with time-inconsistent preferences.

 creates an economic model of anorexia, and evaluates the effect of anorexia
 on longevity by using the health deficit model.
 In the model, deviations from ideal objective bodyweight increases health
 deficits, while deviations from subjective target weight decreases utility.
 The subjective target weight is the individual’s reference point for body
 weight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anorexics are individuals who perpetually decreases their reference point,
 so that they consume less and less food, which increases their health deficit
 accumulation.
 They in a sense becomes addicted to weight loss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The addiction way of understanding anorexia is not controversial in the
 health literature, which makes anorexia a candidate concept to examine
 through the lens of the addiction-deficit models of Strulik.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Calibration of the model begins at a body mass index at 28, and then gradually
 decreases it down to 15.
 The counterfactual computer experiment predicts that anorexics lose 21
 years of age through their life.
